judul: Implementation of Discrete Wavelet Transform and Directed Acyclic Graph SVM for Batik Pattern Recognition
keyword: batik, discrete wavelet transform, directed acyclic graph svm
abstrak: Batik as a heritage of the ancestors of the Indonesian nation, certainly needs to be preserved so that it continues to be recognized from generation to generation, one of which is by introducing the diversity of its patterns. Efforts to introduce batik patterns can be made, one of which is by implementing technology that can recognize batik patterns automatically, based on batik patterns, namely pattern recognition technology. This study aims to optimize batik pattern recognition using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Directed Acyclic Graph SVM (DAGSVM) methods. The stages start from preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. The study used 310 batik images of 7 different patterns and divided them into 240 images for training data and 70 for testing data. The DWT method is used in the feature extraction stage, while DAG SVM is used in the classification stage. The study was conducted by comparing the accuracy between standard DAG SVM and DAG SVM that has been optimized with DWT and the results of the accuracy test proved that adding the DWT method with DAG SVM can increase accuracy by 3%.
